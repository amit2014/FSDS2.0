    "1). The difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses is that square brackets create a list comprehension while parentheses create a generator expression. A list comprehension is a list object containing the results of evaluating an expression in a loop, while a generator expression returns an iterator object that generates the results on-the-fly as they are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2). Generators are a type of iterator in Python. They are functions that use the \"yield\" keyword to return a value and temporarily suspend execution of the function. Iterators are objects that allow iteration over a sequence of values. In other words, generators are a specific type of iterator that uses a function to generate values on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3). A function is a generator function if it contains the \"yield\" keyword. This keyword causes the function to become a generator, which returns an iterator object that generates values on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4). The purpose of a yield statement is to return a value from a generator function and temporarily suspend the function's execution. The generator function can be resumed later, with the next value in the sequence being generated on-the-fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5). Map calls and list comprehensions are both used for transforming data in Python. However, map applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns an iterator object that generates the transformed values. List comprehensions create a list object containing the transformed values generated by evaluating an expression in a loop. The main difference between the two is that map returns an iterator object, while list comprehensions return a list object. This means that list comprehensions may use more memory, but they are generally faster than map calls for smaller iterables. Additionally, map is more flexible in terms of the types of iterables it can handle, while list comprehensions are more concise and easier to read."
